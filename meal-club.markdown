## What is meal club?

The meal club is a once a week meal pickup.  Each meal comes packed in reusable/exchangeable containers and are always vegetarian.  The goal behind these meals is to introduce people to new flavors, personal stories, and unfamiliar cultures.

## Why are you doing this?

I love traveling and eating the things that make a place special.  My way of revisiting a place or a memory is usually through revisiting the flavors of that place.  At most restaurants, you are being sold a delicious thing that also (hopefully) nourishes you.  In addition to giving you something tasty and nutritious to eat, I want the meals to give you more of an understanding of what it is you are eating.  I want you to know where that dish comes from, how people eat it and why it is eaten.

I want you to take the time to travel to another place or another time when you eat these meals.

## What kind of food will it be?

Mostly things that I like to cook but don't do regularly, but are maybe a little bit more involved or that I came across at some point during my travels or food from my childhood that might be hard to find in a restaurant.  Everything will be vegetarian. Sometimes there will be egg.  Sometimes it'll be vegan and/or gluten free.

## What comes with each meal pickup?

You will get 2 containers for every main meal that are dishwasher/microwave safe.  If you get dessert, you get an extra container with your pickup.  All meals are vegan/gluten free unless otherwise noted.  When you come to pick up your next meal, you drop off the containers from the last meal so we don't have to deal with single use containers.

Each meal will also come with reheating instructions, a guide on how to serve the food and descriptions on each individual dish.

## How often do you get meals if you join?

Meals will be available for pickup every Thursday of the month.

## How do you get the food?

Pickup is in south Berkeley.

## How much will it cost?

There is a one time membership fee of $15.  Main meal is $15.  Dessert/extra is $5.

## What do you get for $15?

Enough food for a normal size entree.  Sometimes it will be rice with a few dishes.  Sometimes it will be one main dish.

## How do I sign up?

Space is very limited.  Currently, ordering is by invitation only.  If youâ€™d like to join, please get in touch with me at linh@linh.win
