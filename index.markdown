To me, food is a way to learn about other people and share in their experience.  After graduating from college, I decided to not use my fancy degree (sorry mom) and instead, try my luck in the food world.  From prepping to managing the kitchen, from vertical hierarchy to the collective model to working as a free agent, I’ve spent the last decade eating, cooking and learning.  Outside of my professional baking, cheesing and drinking related work, I also love to go to old and new places, seeking out the stories and people behind the dishes that I find.

I don’t really care about opening a restaurant or getting Michelin stars or anyone knowing who I am.  I want to share the things that I love.
